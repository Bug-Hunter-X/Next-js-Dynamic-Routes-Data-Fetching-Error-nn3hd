# Next.js Dynamic Routes Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Next.js applications involving dynamic routes and data fetching.  The bug manifests as unexpected 404 errors or incorrect data display on pages using dynamic routes. This is often due to an incorrectly implemented `getStaticPaths` function which doesn't return all necessary paths, or `getStaticProps` failing to correctly fetch data for generated paths.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a flawed implementation of `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.  The `getStaticPaths` function might not accurately generate all the paths or generate paths that do not fetch the necessary data in the `getStaticProps` function. This leads to either a 404 error or incorrect data displayed in the user interface.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the issue by ensuring that `getStaticPaths` accurately generates all necessary paths and that `getStaticProps` properly fetches data for each path.  The solution demonstrates best practices for handling dynamic route data fetching in Next.js.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Observe the errors or incorrect data in the UI, then compare with the fix.
