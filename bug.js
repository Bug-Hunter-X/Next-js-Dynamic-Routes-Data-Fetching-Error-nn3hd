In Next.js, a common yet subtle issue arises when working with dynamic routes and data fetching.  If you're not careful about how you structure your `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` functions, you can encounter unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if your `getStaticPaths` doesn't correctly generate all possible paths or if `getStaticProps` fails to fetch data for a specific path, you might see 404 errors or incorrect data displayed on the client-side.
